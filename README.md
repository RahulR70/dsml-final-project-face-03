Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset contains features extracted from images of handwritten digits, and the target variable is the digit label (0-9). The project includes:

Data preprocessing and feature selection.
Model building using various machine learning algorithms.
Model evaluation using classification metrics.
Hyperparameter tuning for the best-performing model.
Dataset Description
The dataset pen+base+recognition+of+handwritten+digits.csv contains the following:

Features: 16 numerical features extracted from handwritten digit images.
Target: A single column representing the digit label (0-9).
The dataset is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for digit recognition.
